# Language-Detection-Model-using-MNB

 I present a language detection model based on the Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB) algorithm. This model is designed to accurately identify the language of a given text or document.

Language detection plays a crucial role in various applications, such as natural language processing, machine translation, and text analytics. The ability to automatically determine the language of a text can enable more targeted and effective language-specific processing.

The MNB algorithm, a variant of Naive Bayes, is particularly suitable for language detection tasks. It leverages the probabilities of word occurrences in different languages to make predictions. By utilizing a multinomial distribution, MNB models can handle text data with multiple word occurrences.

To build the language detection model, I used scikit-learn, a popular machine learning library in Python. I preprocessed the text data by converting it into numerical feature vectors using techniques like the Bag-of-Words representation or TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency). I then trained the MNB classifier on labeled data representing various languages.

The model achieved impressive accuracy in language identification, thanks to the efficient handling of text data by MNB. By employing this language detection model, developers and researchers can enhance their applications by automatically recognizing and adapting to different languages.


Feel free to explore the repository, experiment with different datasets, and adapt the model to your specific language detection requirements. I welcome feedback, contributions, and collaborations to further improve the language detection capabilities provided by this MNB-based model.
